# Amazon-Interview-Questions
I have coded all the questions that Pallav and Co. asked me during my interview with Amazon (all string related questions are in Dynamic Programming repo). I have also included a few of the questions that were asked from my friends. The programs may not be based on the most optimal solutions but please feel free to suggest better and asymptotically faster solutions.
